                    <div class="cs_mainTitle animateIn hideMobile">Rebranding from Touchpress to Amphio</div>

                    <p>In 2016, Touchpress went through a dramatic shift. It sold off its back catalogue of coffee table book apps and its brand to a company called Storytoys.</p>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/touchpress-logo.jpg" alt="The previous Touchpress brand" title="The previous Touchpress brand"/>

                    <p>This left the company with a blank slate, knowing only that it wanted to work with similar clients (music and scientific organisations) but with the aim of solving real problems and not constraining its solutions to being iOS only.</p>

                    <p>The brief then was to create a brand that resonanted with the executives of these organisations but didn’t imply what kind of products the company would produce.</p>

                    <h4>A new direction</h4>

                    <p>The name Amphio was derived from the first half of the word Amphitheatre, referencing the stage on which many of the companies clients present their works, whether that be music, dance or a scientific presentation.</p>

                    <p>Visually we decided to mirror the elegant nature of organisations we worked with and fuse that with a fresh, modern feeling to reflect the digital products that we created.</p>

                    <h4>The logo</h4>

                    <p>I decided to have both a logomark and logotype as the company would be working primarily in digital. Having a responsive logo where the logomark could work alone at small sizes in profile pictures and app icons would be very useful.</p>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/colloseum.jpg" alt="Logo based off amphitheatres" title="Logo based off amphitheatres"/>

                    <p>The logomark itself references the ancient amphitheatres such as the Colosseum, where cultural events occurred. It was drawn by making a simplified 3D model of a similar structure andthen taking renders from various angles to get an interesting shape. I wanted to obfuscate the structure so that it didn‘t tie Amphio or its products too closely to this theme.</p>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/sectra-sample.jpg" alt="Sample of GT Sectra showing its construction" title="Sample of GT Sectra showing its construction"/>

                    <p>For the logotype, I chose GT Sectra, an editorial feeling serif typeface that feels classy while retaining a bit of ‘bite’. This is due to its design being based off the calligraphy of the broad nip pen cut up by a scalpel).</p>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/amphio-logo.jpg" alt="Full Amphio logo" title="Full Amphio logo"/>

                    <h4>Text and colour choices</h4>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/brandon-sample.jpg" alt="Brandon Text &amp; Grotesque samples" title="Brandon Text &amp; Grotesque samples"/>

                    <p>In a deliberate contrast to GT Sectra, I chose to use Brandon Text to be used across the brand. A san-serif featuring large x-height that is much better for digital applications, it also feels more modern while retaining an air of class.</p>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/image-colouring.jpg" alt="Example of the orange gradient applied to imagery" title="Example of the orange gradient applied to imagery"/>

                    <p>For the main brand colour I chose a vivid orange with a dash of salmon. This was to make the brand feel energetic while also setting it apart from the legions of tech start-ups using cyan blue. I also specificed a slight gradient to give it a little more zazz when covering large areas on-screen. This could also be applied as a filter to imagery to tie them closer to the brand.</p>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/colour-choices.jpg" alt="All the brand colours" title="All the brand colours"/>

                    <p>The secondary colour I chose was a very dark blue/purple that is complimentary to the orange that could be used a black replacement e.g as a text colour. A range of purple tinted greys were also derived from this off-black.</p>

                    <p>Finally, I added a Turquoise shade as tertiary colour that could be used for things like buttons and hyperlinks. All the colours have light and dark variants for flexibility but this is especially useful for the turquiose with the dark variant for text and light variant for hover states on buttons.</p>

                    <h4>The snipe</h4>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/snipes.png" alt="New vs old snipe" title="New vs old snipe"/>

                    <p>The snipe was a unique element of the Touchpress derived from its logo that adorns the top corner of all its app icons. As Amphio had retained a few of these apps an replacement snipe was needed. This also worked well as a subtle visual element that could be used through various collateral to reference the brand without being heavy handed.</p>

                    <h4>The website</h4>

                    <img class="cs_articleFullWidthImg animateFade" src="./img/amphio/website.jpg" alt="Amphio home page" title="Amphio home page"/>

                    <p>The shift in the direction meant that after a while just re-dressing the old Touchpress site didn’t fulfil the needs of an agency model. To that end I redesigned the site to centre around case studies  of our previous work first and foremost. These case studies were designed to be destinations that explained the goal of the project, showcasing statistics to show the success of each project and  also to give an insight into the process of working with us.</p>

                    <p>I also took the opportunity to move away from Squarespace towards a static HTML/CSS/JS website to give us complete control of how we wanted it to look and function, making later tweaks such as GDPR compliance a lot easier than if we had to hack around a third-party service.</p>
