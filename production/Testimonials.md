## Louise

What did they get out of it:

- Managed all design duties at amphio, from sprints & prototyping to UX and UI design for the final product.
- Handled the re-branding of the company.
- By taking on more front-end development increased Amphio’s capacity to deliver more work faster.
- Created a positive atmosphere in the office.

No matter what Sam was tasked with he was always able to deliver, from running sprints to designing apps. He also created the identity for the company and was a core member of the team keeping the office motivated. By getting involved with engineering he increased Amphio’s capacity to deliver projects faster.

## Akshay

What did they get out of it:

- Well engineered site (responsive, slick animations, fast, all metadata added, etc).
- Easy to collaborate because Sam worked in the office, could makes changes and test copy as we worked
- Didn’t need to use any more design resource because Sam could deal any additional design work
- Well written and documented code base so any easy changes can be made by Akshay once the project is live.
