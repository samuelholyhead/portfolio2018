## Louise

What did they get out of it:

- Managed all design duties at amphio, from sprints & prototyping to UX and UI design for the final product.
- Handled the re-branding of the company.
- By taking on more front-end development increased Amphio’s capacity to deliver more work faster.
- Created a positive atmosphere in the office.

From running sprints, designing apps or rebranding the company Sam always delivered. By handling design and front-end development he increased Amphio’s capacity to deliver more projects.

## Akshay

What did they get out of it:

- Well engineered site (responsive, slick animations, fast, all metadata added, etc).
- Easy to collaborate because Sam worked in the office, could makes changes and test copy as we worked
- Didn’t need to use any more design resource because Sam could deal any additional design work
- Well written and documented code base so any easy changes can be made by Akshay once the project is live.

We’ve been working with Sam for a few years now, so when we needed someone to engineer the SICC website we knew we were in safe hands. 

He took our desktop designs and delivered a slick responsive website that was well written and documented, allowing us to easily add new content in the future. As he worked onsite, we could easily tweak the design and copy during development leading to a quick and painless process.
