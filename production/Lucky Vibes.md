## Fondation Louis Vuitton: Lucky Vibes

After the success of Archi Moi, an app comporising of 6 mini games to entertain young children, the Fondation asked us to create a game targeting 11 – 18 year olds, the aim being to raise awareness of the Fondation amongst an age group that don‘t visit regularly.

The result of this was Lucky Vibes, a ‘one-touch mechanic’ game in the style of Flappy Bird except instead of just navigating obstacles the player has to catch a stream of musical notes to avoid losing.

### Illustrating the background

As the aim of the game was to raise awareness of the Fondation I decided to make the player flying around the building itself as that is arguebly one of the most visually iconic signifiers of the Fondation. To stay within budget I chose to create a looping background that could be re-dressed to make each level feel unique.

To create a looping background of the Fondation I took the 3D architectural model of the building and took 36 renders of it, rotating the building 10 degrees everytime. Stitching these renders together gave me a image of the building that could loop seemlessly.

I then illustrated the building from this blended image. To make each level feel unique I illustrated the building at different times in the year. events. This gave us 4 levels; Summer, Winter, Late night party and a Fashion Catwalk during an autumn sunset.

### Illustrating the characters

Tonally the Fondation were trying to walk a line between fun but not childish so as not to put off the older teenagers.

To help identify the right balance for the main character I first came up with a range of options for characters and arranged them on a scale from serious to silly.

Of these it was felt the Tuballoon, a brass instrument that sucked in the notes and used them to keep itself floating hit the right mark. From there I took the character through a few evolutions trying to make work at a small size visulluy and keep its dimensions as square as possible as required by our gameplay mechanics.

Our game also featured various obstacles that the player had to avoid. To help keep the process moving I pitched that the obstacles be based off Emoji’s that would fit the theme of the level. To avoid licencing issues I chose to redraw the chosen Emoji’s which also help keep they visually concurrent.
