## Rebranding from Touchpress to Amphio

In 2016, Touchpress went through a dramatic shift. It sold of its back catalogue of coffee-table book-esq apps to a company called Storytoys and also the brand itself.

This left the company with a blank slate, knowing only that it wanted to work with similar clients (music and scientific organisation) but on actual problems rather than gimmicks and not to constrain its solution to being iOS only.

The brief then was to create a brand for the company that resonanted with the executives and audience of these organisations but wasn‘t leading as to what kind of products the company produced.

### A new direction

<Visual of Amphi- dictionary definition>

The name Amphio was derieved form the first half of the word Amphitheatre, referencing the stage on which many of the companies clients present their works, whether that being music, dance or a scientific presentation.

Visually we decided to mirror the elegant nature of organisations we worked with and fuse that with a freshness, modern feeling of the digital products that we created.

### The logo

<Amphio logo>

For the logo I decided that I wanted both a logomark and logotype as the company would be working primarily with the digital sphere and having a responsive logo where the logomark could stand on its own on profile pictures and app icons would be very useful. 

The logomark itself directly references the origins of the compnay name by being an abstracted version of ancient amphitheatres such as the Colosseum. It was drawn by making a simplified 3D model of a similar structure and taking renders from various angles to get a interesting angle that obfusicated the structure so that it didn‘t give any ideas as to what products the company might create.

For the logotype, I chose GT Sectra, an editorial feeling serif typeface that feels classy while retaining a bit of ‘bite’. This is due to its design being based off the calligraphy of the broad nip pen cut up by a scalpel).

To compliment this I chose Brandon Text to be used as the main brand type. I deliberately contrasted the classy serif GT Sectra with a san-serif featuring large x-height that is much better for digital applications and feeels more modern.

### Colour choices

<Orange gradient>

For the main brand colour I chose to go for a vivid orange with a dash of salmon. This was to make the brand feel energetic and also set it apart from the legions of tech start-ups using cyan blue. I also specificed a slight gradient to give it a little more zazz when covering large areas on-screen.

<Dark purple example>

The secondary colour I chose was a very dark blue/purple that is complimentary to the orange that could be used a black replacement e.g as a text colour. A range of purple tinted greys were also derived from this off-black.

<Different turquoises in use>

Finally, I added a Turquoise shade as tertiary colour that could be used for things like buttons and hyperlinks. All the colours have light and dark varients for flexibility but this is especially useful for this turquiose when you would want a dark varient for text and light varient for hover states on buttons.

### The snipe

<The amphio snipe (maybe vs touchpress snipe)>

A unique element of the Touchpress brand was a snipe derived from its logo that adorns the top corner of all Touchpress app icons. As Amphio had retained a few music apps a replacement snipe was needed. This also worked well as a subtle visual element that could be used through various collateral to reference the brand without being heavy handed.
