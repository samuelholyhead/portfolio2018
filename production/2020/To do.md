### Cover letter

Iâ€™m a UX/UI designer who recently completed a 14 month contract at the creative technology company Rehab, working with clients such as Google, Nike Facebook, HSBC. I worked across the product development cycle starting with discovery phases and design sprints to understand and define what we should be creating, testing prototypes with our users to verify our concept before then building the product, which ranged from voice assistants and web apps to native apps and D-apps.

Before that I worked at Amphio and Tengio both as a designer but also as a front-end developer, working on React web apps, native Android apps and also Cross-platform apps built with Flutter.

Additionally, I also lecture on the BA (Hons) Graphic Design course, tutoring a group of final year students as well as running UX workshops and digitally focused briefs.
