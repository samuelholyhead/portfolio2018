# Design sprint extra

### Example prototype

Throughout the transformation project, we continued to run design sprints to quickly identify problems and validate potential solutions.

- News articles to show the latest from around the Institute.
- Allow users to customise the types of content displayed to them.

The prototype starts after a user has searched for the ‘Institute of Physics’. Tap the top search result to begin…
